This is a C++11/14 game engine built for Windows 7+ with Visual Studio 2013.

## Goals

1. To be simple and minimalistic.

2. To use modern C++ features effectively.

3. To be instructive on a wide range of features typically found in a 3D game engine.

## Ideas for improvement

- Separate thread for rendering, i.e. "Render Thread".

- Re-save converted models for faster loading.

- Better logging mechanism: message box, log-to-file, filename / line, channels, in-game, etc.

- A performance profiler.

- A resource manager which handles all resource loading (possibly on a separate thread).

- Xbox or Wii controller input.

- Action mappings for input: "Jump" maps to VK_SPACE, etc.
